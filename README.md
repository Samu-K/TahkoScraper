# TahkoScraper
A scrapy crawler and some python files to scrape a website and do some work on the data.

TahkoScraper.rar has the whole scrapy project file

tahko_scraper.py has the code for the spider.
Note that it cannot run on it's own

data_handler.py is goes through the data and adds an 'Unique Event' column, and converts it to csv

data_exploration.py is an interactable program that can help you go through the data and get some info from it.

This is mainly just a fun personal project, so that I could learn scrapy.
