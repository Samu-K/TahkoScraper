# TahkoScraper

A scrapy based web crawler to go through the events table of tahko.fi to find out what events are happening currently.

TahkoScraper.rar has the whole scrapy project file

tahko_scraper.py has the code for the spider.
data_handler.py goes through the data and adds an 'Unique Event' column, and converts it to csv
data_exploration.py is an interactable program that can help you go through the data and get some info from it.

Main focus of this project was to learn how to work with scrapy and to learn some general web scraping.
